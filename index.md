# Something about Chen
Hi, I am Zhicheng Xu and you can call me Chen instead. I come from China and started studying bioinformatics in Lund University this autumn in 2020.

I got my Bachelor degree in Software Engineering. When I was in my third year, I studied data analysis, dealing with biological and medical data. aI found it more interesting to study the connection between these data sets and how to analyze the data in both statistical and biological ways. That's why I chose to study bioinformatics for my Master degree.

Hopefully everything will be fine!
